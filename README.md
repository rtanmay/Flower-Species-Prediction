# Flower-Species-Prediction
This repository predicts the species of flower using the *Iris flower dataset* 

For prediction the following algorithms are used:

    1)Logistic Regression (LR)
   
    2)Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
    
    3)K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    
    4)Classification and Regression Trees (CART)
    
    5)Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)
    
    6)Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Accuracy of each algorithm is calculated to check the best algorithm
